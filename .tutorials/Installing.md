## Using Github - Installing Git
As the intro document mentioned, **Git** is a separate thing from **Github**.

**Github** is the *collaborative* portion of the process, while **Git** is the local portion. It is what allows you to track
 your changes locally, and work with your repository here on Github.

There are a few options as far as using Git goes, but you will need at least one to work on a Github repository easily.

We will look at **Installing Git CLI** (command line interface) and **Installing a Git Visual Client**

#### Step #1: Installing Git CLI

This is required even for some visual clients, but the bare minimum you need is the Git CLI.

This is a command-line tool that allows you to use Git, and is required to use the commands Dr. Leinecker demonstrated
in the class (without using a terminal built into another piece of software.)

[This link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) provides a step-by-step guide on installing 
Git CLI based on your operating system, but for linux systems it is often as simple as using your package manager of choice
to complete the installation:

    sudo apt install git-all
    
If you are on Windows, Git CLI can be installed by [downloading](https://git-scm.com/download/win) the most recent version.

#### Option #2: Using a Visual Client
While there are some operations that are best handled via the command line, and the experience is useful in case a visual 
client fails to do what you want, you may prefer the convenience of using a **visual client** for Git operations.

These provide a simple way for you to connect to a Github repo, clone it, and do all the operations needed to work and collaborate.

Personally I have used the Git tools built into many IDEs such as Visual Studio, or PHPStorm. However, there are some standalone
 tools like [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (which I am using for this project) or 
 [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) (which I have not yet used) that can make getting into Git a simpler process.

Once you have some form of Git available for your use, the next step is detailed in [Getting Started.](./GettingStarted.md)
