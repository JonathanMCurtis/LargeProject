## Using Github
**Git** is a version control system (VCS) that allows you to save a copy of your project at a particular point in time,
see the changes you make to your code over time. This allows you to review your changes, revert your changes, work on
different versions of a file, and combine those versions.

**Github** is a way for people working on the same set of code to collaborate using Git. 
It allows us to save a version of the code we write (**commit**), submit it to the repository (**push**), 
and then make a request to combine that code into the main project (**pull request**.) 

While this document will help you get up and running for the project, if you are interested in learning about Github in 
a more in-depth context, I can recommend the same link as found in the
SHPE repository's introduction: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

Assuming *everyone* is contributing to the project, Github will play a large role in ensuring that our changes do not 
step on any toes (especially with so many people working on the front-end towards the end!)

The biggest help here (besides sharing code) is that we will likely have [merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-merge-conflicts).

While this sounds like a bad thing, it's actually extremely helpful in an environment where multiple people are working 
on the same code. The idea is that when two people edit a file, it should be reviewed to see if there are any problems that 
would arise from simply pushing the two changes into a single new file.

Merge conflicts are something that you won't have to worry about resolving, just understand that they are there to prevent 
changes from clashing with each other.
