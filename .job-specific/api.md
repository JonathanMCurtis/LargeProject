### Week 3

The week 3 expectations (from Dr. Leinecker) are to **'Complete the API'** and **'Make sure you get swagger done too.'**

Working from that expectation, here are my recommendations for Week 3

#### Task 1: Complete all expected API endpoints

Based upon the basic tasks expected for our recipe website, as well as the document structure laid out by the Database 
team, implement all expected API endpoints for this project.

#### Task 2: Complete documentation for all API endpoints

While SwaggerHub would be the ideal here, there is quite a bit of additional work placed on both members of the API team.

As such, providing a clear and detailed documentation to the front-end team for all endpoints will meet the expectations 
for week 2. This would ideally be completed on SwaggerHub, but at the minimum an API document should be shared on Github.
