### Front-End (General Info)

As there is quite a bit of overlap between the two, the landing page for the front-end is a shared page.
There are still more specific pages for both the [Web Application](front-end-web.md) and the [Mobile Application](front-end-mobile.md),
but the information here should be common between both groups.

As the front-end is where a large portion of our work is going to be done, I would like to request you try to utilize 
Github as often as is reasonable for you. My preference would be that you **push** whenever you believed you have finish
a checkmark on the Projects board, and submit a **pull request** to the development branch (or master, if there are none) 
whenever you believe you have finished a task (card) from the Projects board. Pushing to your dev branch more often is 
always preferable. 

Remember, we are not graded on our commits between the start and finish of the project. It's what the project looks like 
at the finish that will be graded. Frequent commits allow code to be reviewed for bugs before milestones, and pushing 
completed features allows you to immediately test your feature on Heroku (as it will be automatically deployed.)

Week 3 expectations (from Dr. Leinecker) are that the **'the webapp and mobile UIs are taking shape.'**

As such, here are the tasks that are common between *all* of front-end this week: 

#### Task #1: Document the required pages for this application

How you complete this task is up to you, but some form of planning will need to be completed to show what pages we 
intend to include in our application.

This could be a document containing a list of these pages, or it could simply be creating an empty file for each page,
even if the file does not yet serve any functionality.

This task is intended to help provide a sense of direction for the project, and to provide some insight on future API 
endpoints that might be required. 

#### Task #2: Begin creating these required pages

From the list above, work on these pages in the order and capacity that you see fit. Just keep in mind that the 
expectations from Dr. Leinecker are that these pages will be fully functional in **two weeks**
