### Front-End (General Info)

As there is quite a bit of overlap between the two, the landing page for the front-end is a shared page.
There are still more specific pages for both the [Web Application](front-end-web.md) and the [Mobile Application](front-end-mobile.md),
but the information here should be common between both groups.

As the front-end is where a large portion of our work is going to be done, I would like to request you try to utilize 
Github as often as is reasonable for you. My preference would be that you **push** whenever you believed you have finish
a checkmark on the Projects board, and submit a **pull request** to the development branch (or master, if there are none) 
whenever you believe you have finished a task (card) from the Projects board. Pushing to your dev branch more often is 
always preferable. 

Remember, we are not graded on our commits between the start and finish of the project. It's what the project looks like 
at the finish that will be graded. Frequent commits allow code to be reviewed for bugs before milestones, and pushing 
completed features allows you to immediately test your feature on Heroku (as it will be automatically deployed.)

Week 2 expectations (from Dr. Leinecker) are that the **'front-end should begin to do the UI'** (for both web and mobile.)

As such, here are the tasks that are common between *all* of front-end this week: 

#### Task #1: Work Distribution

Front-end work is going to be a **huge** portion of this project, regardless of the task we approach. Unless we decide 
to implement Mongoose, the database is technically "done." The API will spend some time on SwaggerHub documentation and 
functions, but that is short in comparison to the amount of work that will be done for front-end.

As such, it would be imperative to decide a few things about the front-end workflow:

1. How will we distribute the front-end tasks?
    - Will we go for a style similar to our 'full stack' choice from the survey, where all tasks are available for any 
  front-end to take on?
    - Will we dedicate specific people to web/mobile, or will the assignments be more fluid?
    - How will this fit with the addition of new front-end help in about a week?
2. If web/mobile will be assigned to specific people, who has been chosen for each role currently?

**Please discuss these amongst the current front-end team, and confirm your decisions either via Discord or the related 
Issue Page.**

#### Task #2: Framework Selection

A big part of my planning (in terms of tasks, pages, and providing learning resources) depends on the library, frameworks, 
or applications we will be using to develop web and mobile.

**Please discuss this amongst the appropriate front-end team (either combined, or separate web/mobile) and confirm your 
decisions via Discord, or the related Issue Page.**

#### Task #3: Begin to implement UI

While we do not have a finalized version of our functionality, both web and mobile will be able to begin with some basic 
assumptions. 

Your job-specific pages will provide more detailed information, but remember: You are always welcome to add/remove 
content as you see fit. These are simply *suggestions* to keep us on-track for completion!

**Please make commits containing a selection of pages that you believe this application will find useful.** Styling is 
not currently a requirement, they do not have to serve any function, and they do not have to be finalized or laid out 
perfectly at this time. The main expectation is the presence of pages, and the components you think those pages require.
