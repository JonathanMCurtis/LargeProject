### Front-End (Mobile)

As there is quite a bit of overlap between the two, I want to make sure you are aware of the Front-End
[general info page.](front-end.md) It contains tasks and information common to the two front-end apps. 
Hopefully that's how you arrived here!

### Week 2

Week 2 expectations (from Dr. Leinecker) are that the **'Mobile Application should begin to do the UI'**

Working from that expectation, here are my recommendations for Week 2

#### Task #1: Work Distribution

(Also on the front-end [general info page.](front-end.md))

1. How will we distribute the front-end tasks?
    - Will we go for a style similar to our 'full stack' choice from the survey, where all tasks are available for any 
  front-end to take on?
    - Will we dedicate specific people to web/mobile, or will the assignments be more fluid?
    - How will this fit with the addition of new front-end help in about a week?
2. If web/mobile will be assigned to specific people, who has been chosen for each role currently?

**Please discuss these amongst the current front-end team and confirm your decisions via Discord, or the related 
[Issue Page.](https://github.com/JonathanMCurtis/LargeProject/issues/2)**

#### Task #2: Framework Selection

(Also on the front-end [general info page.](front-end.md))

A big part of my planning (in terms of tasks, pages, and providing learning resources) depends on the library, frameworks, 
or applications we will be using to develop the mobile application.

**Please discuss this amongst the appropriate front-end team (either combined, or mobile) and confirm your 
decisions via Discord, or the related [Issue Page.](https://github.com/JonathanMCurtis/LargeProject/issues/3)**

#### Task #3: Begin to implement UI

While we do not have a finalized version of our functionality, both web and mobile will be able to begin with some basic 
assumptions. 

1. You *may* like to have a 'landing page' for your app.
    - This could include featured recipes, buttons to log in or create an account, or other welcoming features.
2. Users will need to be able to **create** an account.
    - This page should include a way to enter signup information
3. Users will need to **login** to the application
    - This page should include a way to enter login information
    - This page should include a link to request a password reset.
4. We will need a page to **display** a recipe.
    - An example recipe will be provided.
    - You may prefer a scrollable view, or a series of cards (Ingredients, Step 1, Step 2, ...)
5. We will need a page to **search** for recipes.
    - You will need some way for the user to provide search criteria
        - How you make this possible is your discretion.
        - It could be a text search, drop-down boxes, or simple and image-based like AllRecipe's search function.  
6. You may create any other pages you believe could be used in the application, as your discretion and time permit.

**Please make commits containing a selection of pages that you believe this application will find useful.** Styling is 
not currently a requirement, they do not have to serve any function, and they do not have to be finalized or laid out 
perfectly at this time. The main expectation is the presence of pages, and the components you think those pages require.
