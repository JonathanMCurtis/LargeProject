### Front-End (Web)

As there is quite a bit of overlap between the two, I want to make sure you are aware of the Front-End
[general info page.](front-end.md) It contains tasks and information common to the two front-end apps. 
Hopefully that's how you arrived here!

### Week 3

Week 3 expectations (from Dr. Leinecker) are that the **'the webapp UI is taking shape.'**

With that in mind, here are the recommended tasks for Week 3: 

#### Task #1: Document the required pages for this application

How you complete this task is up to you, but some form of planning will need to be completed to show what pages we 
intend to include in our application.

This could be a document containing a list of these pages, or it could simply be creating an empty file for each page,
even if the file does not yet serve any functionality.

This task is intended to help provide a sense of direction for the project, and to provide some insight on future API 
endpoints that might be required. 

#### Task #2: Begin creating these required pages

From the list above, work on these pages in the order and capacity that you see fit. Just keep in mind that the 
expectations from Dr. Leinecker are that these pages will be fully functional in **two weeks**
